**ABOUT**
**Hi there, and welcome to Laughing Coyote!**
**I'm Elsa, and I love creating colorful and unconventional websites.**
**As someone who has started a creative career from the ground up, I know what its like to be overwhelmed with figuring out web design, selling strategies, and marketing. This was what Laughing Coyote Dev was created for, to save you some headaches that come with learning about:** - **how to design a website** - **how to pick a domain and use hosting** - **and etc! See services below!**

Services Include:
-Service and Support
I assist with: domains, hosting, web development and design. In other words... pretty much everything from setup to ongoing service, leaving you more time to spend on your business!

-Development and design advantages
As a developer who designs, I rely on Javascript languages and frameworks, mainly NextJs. My knowledge on coding gives me the advantage to design and breaking the limits!

-Monthly Updates
Need to make a change? Or add more content or photos?. Monthly updates are available with subscription.

-Mobile Optimization
Studies show that the majority of website visitors use phones and tablets, as opposed to computers at home.
